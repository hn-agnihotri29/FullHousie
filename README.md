# FullHousie
Inspired from the famous boardgame Tambola/Housie, we have come up with our own version, "FULLHOUSIE". Try your luck with our game!!!
The zeal and enthusiasm to take part in the Hackathon:**Snakes and Hackers 2**, while also creating something not easily available out there on the internet, inspired us to create a project based on the theme, i.e. Boardgames.  Namely, **FULLHOUSIE** .

## What it does
Considerably a game of two, Fullhousie enables two players to have a test on their luck. On starting a new game, the players are required to choose a ticket for themselves, and then click on the "New Number" button, on every click, a new number is generated which is sent to each of the tickets chosen by the players to check for a match. This continues until any of the player's ticket completes 15 matches. Upon which, we shall have a _full-house_ and also our winner!!

## How we built it
Designed and structured using HTML and CSS for the frontend of our project, while we used JavaScript (ejs templating language) as the backbone for the working of our game. We used ejs script tag in order to run JavaScript code within HTML. Further, using DOM for event management within our game.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Reasoning on different options to store, randomize and modify the player tickets.
2. While figuring out algorithms for different parts of our project was like an enjoyable brainstorming session, seeing some of it fail was equally annoying.
3. A more comprehensive understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and learning wider aspects about these languages.
4. Fathom how to display our winner or store counts.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. This being the very **first Hackathon** and being able to come up with a working model of the project is an accomplishment for both of us.
2. Being able to create a boardgame from scratch was a nice experience!
3. Exploring both the frontend and the backend as this was our very **first project**.

## What we learned
Learning how to solve different issues that we generally don't face while solving coding questions was something new, also being able to work and brainstorm as a team has been a great experience.
We also learnt how systematic approach to solving a project is a very important part of developing it.

## What's next for FullHousie
Currently, even though our game functions pretty fine under the hood, we shall have to work on updates, that'll make the ticket matching process more visual like the random number generation.
We are also looking forward to extend it into a multiplayer server based game.
